        <p>Fangames, also known as Guy or I Wanna games, are a niche genre of freeware platformer games. Whether you know of some popular fangames like Not Another Needle Game, Boshy, or Kamilia 3, or if you're totally new, this page will hopefully give you a quick overview of what the fangame community is all about!</p>
        <p>Check out some game screenshots!</p>

        <h2 id="Basics">The basics</h2>
        <p>Fangames are based on super-tight player physics, a double jump, and instant and infinite respawns when you die. There are many genres that all share this common ground, including action-adventure, intricate platforming, bullet hell, medleys of other fangames, and more. Their full name is technically "IWBTG fangames" since they originated from a game called I Wanna Be The Guy (read below), but we shorten it to just "fangames".</p>

        </div>

        <p>All of the 5000+ fangames are free to download and play! And most are not GPU-intensive, so older computers can run them just fine. The default controls are, by tradition, Shift to jump, Z to shoot, R to respawn, and Escape to quit.</p>

        <p>Our community plays and chats about fangames 24 hours a day on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/I%20Wanna%20Be%20The%20Guy" target="_blank">Twitch IWBTG directory</a>. Speedrunning fangames is popular, and we track records on our <a href="http://www.speedrun.com/iwbtgfg" target="_blank">Speedrun.com page</a>.

        <h2 id="Backstory">A little backstory</h2>
        <p>Fangame history begins in 2007 when Kayin made the original <a href="http://kayin.moe/iwbtg/" target="_blank">I Wanna Be The Guy</a>, a game full of humor and challenge. At first, fangames of IWBTG closely imitated its formula of humorous traps and pop references. But over the years, their design gradually evolved into something else entirely. Today, fangames are an ecosystem of their own, with their own tropes and genres, and with authors and players from around the globe.</p>
        <p>Fangames gradually became popular on Twitch simply because they're entertaining to watch. Speedrunning in particular is popular, with games like <a href="http://www.speedrun.com/iwbtboshy" target="_blank">Boshy</a> (featured in many a GDQ!), <a href="http://www.speedrun.com/iwktkamilia2" target="_blank">Kamilia 2</a>, <a href="http://www.speedrun.com/nang" target="_blank">NANG</a> (featured in AGDQ 2017!), and many more. As a community we also host an annual weekend-long <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fangamemarathon" target="_blank">Speedrun Marathon</a> on Twitch.</p>

        <h2 id="Making">Making fangames: the other side of the community</h2>
        <p>Making fangames is open to everyone, and can be very fun and rewarding. Upsides include: The base engine with player physics is a convenient starting point, there are many veteran fangame creators to get help from and collaborate with, and your game is guaranteed an audience and playtime on Twitch!</p>
        <p>If you want to jump in, check out <a href="http://klazen.com/IWBTG/tutorial/dev_tutorial.html" target="_blank">Klazen's Tutorial</a>. Don't hesitate to ask the community for help! A good place to get help is in the <a href="https://discord.gg/SjpjuaH">I Wanna Community Discord server</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="Closing">In closing</h2>
        <p>Hopefully you now have an idea of what fangames are, and how to connect with our community! If you have any lingering questions, or if something was confusing, please tell me since I'd like to make this page as good as it can be!
