        <h2>The basics</h2>
        <p>Fangames are all based on the same super-tight player physics, a double jump, and instant and infinite respawns when you die. There are many genres that all share this common ground, including action-adventure, intricate platforming, bullet hell, medleys of other fangames, and more.</p>
         <p>All fangames are free to download and play! They're also not GPU-intensive, so older computers can run them just fine. The default controls are, by tradition, Shift to jump, Z to shoot, R to respawn, and Escape to quit.</p>
         <p>Our community plays and chats about fangames 24 hours a day on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/I%20Wanna%20Be%20The%20Guy" target="_blank">Twitch IWBTG directory</a>. Speedrunning fangames is popular, and we track records on our <a href="http://www.speedrun.com/iwbtgfg" target="_blank">Speedrun.com page</a>. And last but not least, our main website which indexes most of the 5000+ fangames is <a href="http://delicious-fruit.com/" target="_blank">Delicious Fruit</a>.</p>

        <h2>A little backstory</h2>
        <p>Fangame history begins in 2007 when Kayin made the original <a href="http://kayin.moe/iwbtg/" target="_blank">I Wanna Be The Guy</a>, a game full of humor and challenge. At first, fangames of IWBTG closely imitated its formula of humorous traps and pop references. But over the years, their design gradually evolved into something else entirely. Today, fangames are an ecosystem of their own, with their own tropes and genres, and with authors and players from around the globe.</p>
        <p>Fangames gradually became popular on Twitch simply because they're entertaining to watch. Speedrunning in particular is popular, with games like <a href="http://www.speedrun.com/iwbtboshy" target="_blank">Boshy</a> (featured in many an AGDQ!), <a href="http://www.speedrun.com/iwktkamilia2" target="_blank">Kamilia 2</a>, <a href="http://www.speedrun.com/nang" target="_blank">NANG</a> (featured in AGDQ 2017!), and many more. As a community we also host an annual weekend-long <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fangamemarathon" target="_blank">Speedrun Marathon</a> on Twitch.</p>

        <h2>In closing</h2>
