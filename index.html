      In 2007, a guy called Kayin released <a href="http://iwbtg.kayin.moe/" target="_blank">I Wanna Be The Guy</a>, a freeware platformer with an interesting mix of challenge and humor. People were inspired to make their own fangames in the style of IWBTG, with their own unique take on its design. Over the years, people from all over the world joined in, and fangames grew into a phenomenon of their own, with their own genres, tropes, and general style. Today, in 2016, there are over 4000 fangames, and communities around the world are going strong, both making and playing fangames, and pushing them to their limits.
      <br>
      <br>
      Most fangames share a certain odd set of traits: the same exact player physics with a double-jump, 32-pixel blocks and spikes, a screen resolution of 800x608, a few specific borrowed graphics, and gameplay inspired by other fangames. To give you some examples of what gameplay is like, below is a list of a few common tropes and some games listed for each.
      <br>-->
      
      <br>
      Fangames, also known as Guy Games and I Wanna games, are a niche subgenre of platformers. You play as an 11 by 21px kid with a double jump and tight controls, and you navigate interesting and challenging platforming. We, the community who make, play, and speedrun these games, are active 24 hours a day on Twitch, especially our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/team/thewannabes" target="_blank">Twitch Team</a>.
      <br><br>
      Fangame difficulty can range from easy, such as <a href="http://delicious-fruit.com/ratings/game_details.php?id=10550" target="_blank">I wanna be the Animus</a>, to notoriously difficult such as <a href="http://delicious-fruit.com/ratings/game_details.php?id=14681" target="_blank">I wanna Kill the Kamilia 3</a>. But challenge isn't the only thing fangames have to offer; there's huge variety in the 5000+ fangames listed on <a href="http://delicious-fruit.com/" target="_blank">Delicious Fruit</a>.
      <br>
      
      <!--<br>
      Fangames are a unique subgenre of platformers with their own weird charm. As a tiny kid with tight movement, you weave through spikes, dodge apples, fight bosses, and experience thousands of tiny adventures. We, the people who play, make, and speedrun these games, are a small but passionate community and we'd love to spread the word about the awesomeness of fangames.
      <br><br>
      <a href="http://iwbtg.kayin.moe/" target="_blank">I Wanna Be The Guy</a> was the original game back in 2007. Since then people have made over 4000 fangames, and they've evolved into a phenomenon of their own. A few fangames are popular on Twitch, notably I Wanna Be The Boshy, but it's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the variety these games have to offer.

      <h1>Making fangames</h1>
      Most fangames are made in a piece of software called GameMaker, which is powerful and beginner-friendly software for 2D game development. You're by no means forced to use GameMaker, but just be aware that the standard player physics people are used to are implemented in GameMaker.
      <br><br>
      <a href="http://klazen.com/IWBTG/tutorial/dev_tutorial.html" target="_blank">Klazen's Tutorial</a> is pretty much the go-to resource for starting out.
      <br><br>
      You can post in the forums if you have any programming, design, or other questions. We have quite a few experienced people who enjoy helping others out with making fangames.
